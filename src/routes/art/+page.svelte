        My 2024 New Years resolution was to paint one painting a week in an effort to learn some new art skills.
        I really like watercolor paintings for the pastels and the chaos that comes from the surface tension of 
        water on the paper. 
    </p>

    <p> 
        To help learn, I picked up "Stunning Watercolor Skies" by Rachael Mae Moyles which has really simple and 
        effective techniques for landscapes, something I've always enjoyed photographing on camping trips. Below
        are some of my paintings, earliest to latest as the year progresses.

            reflected the setting sun. The trees without leaves are supposed to be pecan trees, with Southern Oaks on the right.">

        <Art title="Liam, on a hill" description="I was trying out some new paper and pigments and decided to paint a picture my wife mentioned
            that she enjoyed. There were more buildings in the background in the original, but I wasn't confident enough to attempt them. However, 
            the Google sail building made it. I also added a tree to make things a little more colorful.">

        <Art title="Colorful Winter Sunrise" description="This was the next painting style in the book. I think it turned out really nice! I like the 
            subtle yellow against the snow. The tree and shadow is also a more complex technique I've not used before.">

        <Art title="Pine tree at sunset, and Marble Countertops" description="I bought some new brushes and wanted to test them out bit not commit
            to the next chapter in the watercolor book. It was fun to test them out, they are more circular and hold water differently than the flatter
            brushes. The marble is the latest pattern my wife has zeroed in on for countertops. I'm not sure about it but she seems dead set since
            Lowe's has a nice display that showcases how she sees the counters / kitchen.">

        <Art title="Birthday painting for my wife" description="I painted this for my wife's birthday based on her work for our
            neighborhood ceramic art wall that was a community effort. She worked on the 3 red flowers (Her, Liam, and Me), and the pink flower (her 
            sister), and purple flower (her mom). It feels kind of basic. I need to get back to working on the book, but time
            is elusive, or more likely the next painting is intimidating and I'm procrastinating...">

            in the year 2000 at the Capital Area Food Bank for a Freshman Honor's Society event. I painted 23 hearts
            to represent the 23 valentine's days we've had. I realized my improv art ability still needs a lot of work
            and I need to develop outside the nature scene book as well. Time for another book?">

            said that some of the flowers had red centers which meant they had been visited by bees. He was so proud of his flowers and sharing
            that information, it was a great moment. I painted the flowers this week as a reminder of that moment.">
