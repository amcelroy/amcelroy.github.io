        I tried to paint one watercolor picture a week last year, but fell a little short. These are my 2024 attempts. Hoping to add more in 
        2025, as I really started cranking stuff out towards Christmas for gifts. I'm not really a "Generic Card Guy" so I've been making my
        art into cards for friends and family. I hope people enjoy them!

            <p>
                I painted 2 pictures this week, one for Sara and one
                for my sister. Sara's ended up a little less than I wanted, but is more meaningful, it is the stuff
                that she does for the family that she typically takes care of. Shopping for food, Liam's doctors appointments,
                the lawn, and Liam's laundry. She also helped win Trashion Fashion with Liam, for which he won a trophy, so I tried
                to incorporate that as well. I'm not really used to drawing items, so I think it looks a little sophmoric.

            <p>
                Mariah's though, it turned out great! It is a picture of the eclipse, which she spent a lot of time organizing
                and planning for. It was an amazing, amazing family event that I'm really proud of her for pulling together
                and sharing with everyone. I used salt to alter the surface tension of the water which gave some of the edges
                an almost fractal feel.

                It has been a while. I did some paintings when I left BSM
                but never posted them. I got a 3D printer just before the holidays and have been enjoying messing around with
                printing gifts and art ideas. One idea I had was to create masks I could use for watercolor paintings. My in-laws 
                hippies at heart, my wife's dad and 2nd wife love the peace movement and peace sign. I made a mask for a peace
                sign and had fun with trying to make vivid colors using small pools of water with pigmant difused in it.

                The Eiffel Tower I painted for my sister, she had just taken a trip to the Netherlands and Paris with a friend
                and I've been to Paris twice and enjoyed the Eiffel tower both times. It is also iconic and not a spwarling palace
                so it works with a vertical canvas.

            <p>
                This one was for mom. I was going to print a tree shaped as a heart that 
                I found, except I inverted it in Shapr3d and FreeCAD. I went to print it and all the inversions weren't connected
                to the main body of the tree and fell off. Oops. I will keep that in mind next time I decide to invert a model.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made the most of it and split the heart into 3, once color for Sara, Liam, and me and tried to turn them into
                flowers that connected in the center. My sister got me a nice book for Christmas about using ink with watercolor
                to help with lines and masking, and I think some of those techniques would have made this one pop more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless, I was pretty proud of it!

                not getting one, well, that was less exciting. She said she did get a carnation in high school, so I painted her one so 
                she could get her first carnation for Valentine's day.

                PCB design using an MCU and I'm pretty happy with how things have turned out. I designed the frame 
                to be 3D printed, the PCB to power the LEDs including a level shifter and reservoir capacitor, written
                the firmware in Rust to handle the BLE communication, written a WASM / no_std library for the `dotstar` 
                LEDs, and written a React Native app with BLE to control the LEDs wirelessly. Phew. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Behold, the frame in all its glory. The phone does not capture the dynamic range of the human eye
                and it looks a lot better in person.

        <Art title="Sheri's Birthday">
            <p>
                I got a new spirograph that has finer teeth and nice features. Time to put it to use for a birthday gift.
                Aunt Sheri does a lot of nice cooking and keeps a level head when things get crazy. She takes care of 
                her mom and Trig, and probably doesn't get enough credit. I wanted to make her something and went with 
                a spirograph with an earth, sun, sky feel. The frame is the one I've designed for the LEDs but don't
                have an LED strip of circuits right now, so it is just a frame.

                I really like the color gradients and the masking.

        <Art title="Enzo's Birthday">
            <p>
                Been a while since I painted, but it was a fun one. My nephew Enzo's birthday was this weekend and we got him this really cool ceiling
                projector that projects a dynamic galaxy pattern in all sorts of different colors. It has green laser lights that speckle the galaxy
                pattern. What better painting than of a galaxy! I tried out some new metalic paints that I got a few months ago. The picture doesn't do
                the metalic paint justtice, it really does sparkle under the light. 

                Liam and Sara helped place starts using a white ink pen. Turned out pretty well for a family effort.

        <Art title="Mary Jane's Birthday">
            <p>
                Sara's mom has a birthdya coming up, and Sara made her mom a bookmark with these really pretty flowers 
                that were really dainty with dark purple petals. The stems kind of merge together and there were some 
                whispy leaves on the side. Seemed like a fun little project with 3 colors, perfect for some water coloring.

                Liam was out front doing tricks on his scooter and the evening was gorgeous, 80 with a strong breeze, overcast
                to mute the light, and little traffic to worry about on Good Friday. I sat out front with him and painted under
                the grey sky as the evening turned almost a yellowish color as the sun set. 4/4 evening watching my son and
                painting.

        <Art title="Family Reunion">
            <p>
                My wife's family had their reunion in late April and a big portion of it was poolside swimming. Sara's cousin, Paul, loves wearing speedos 
                and small bathing suits and fortunately, he brought one for the other 3 guy cousin's / cousin-in-laws &#128517;. Sara's cousin that hosted the
                event starting doing potato charactures during COVID, so I thought I would paint her a family reunion picture. Note the sparkly paint for the 
                speedo just to help it pop even more.
