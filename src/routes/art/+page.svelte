        I tried to paint one watercolor picture a week last year, but fell a little short. These are my 2024 attempts. Hoping to add more in 
        2025, as I really started cranking stuff out towards Christmas for gifts. I'm not really a "Generic Card Guy" so I've been making my
        art into cards for friends and family. I hope people enjoy them!

        <Art title="Week 18 - Mother's Day">
            <p>
                I painted 2 pictures this week, one for Sara and one
                for my sister. Sara's ended up a little less than I wanted, but is more meaningful, it is the stuff
                that she does for the family that she typically takes care of. Shopping for food, Liam's doctors appointments,
                the lawn, and Liam's laundry. She also helped win Trashion Fashion with Liam, for which he won a trophy, so I tried
                to incorporate that as well. I'm not really used to drawing items, so I think it looks a little sophmoric.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mariah's though, it turned out great! It is a picture of the eclipse, which she spent a lot of time organizing
                and planning for. It was an amazing, amazing family event that I'm really proud of her for pulling together
                and sharing with everyone. I used salt to alter the surface tension of the water which gave some of the edges
                an almost fractal feel.

        <Art title="Christmas for Mariah and In-Laws">
            <p>
                It has been a while. I did some paintings when I left BSM
                but never posted them. I got a 3D printer just before the holidays and have been enjoying messing around with
                printing gifts and art ideas. One idea I had was to create masks I could use for watercolor paintings. My in-laws 
                hippies at heart, my wife's dad and 2nd wife love the peace movement and peace sign. I made a mask for a peace
                sign and had fun with trying to make vivid colors using small pools of water with pigmant difused in it.

                The Eiffel Tower I painted for my sister, she had just taken a trip to the Netherlands and Paris with a friend
                and I've been to Paris twice and enjoyed the Eiffel tower both times. It is also iconic and not a spwarling palace
                so it works with a vertical canvas.

        <Art title="Christmas for Mom">
            <p>
                This one was for mom. I was going to print a tree shaped as a heart that 
                I found, except I inverted it in Shapr3d and FreeCAD. I went to print it and all the inversions weren't connected
                to the main body of the tree and fell off. Oops. I will keep that in mind next time I decide to invert a model.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made the most of it and split the heart into 3, once color for Sara, Liam, and me and tried to turn them into
                flowers that connected in the center. My sister got me a nice book for Christmas about using ink with watercolor
                to help with lines and masking, and I think some of those techniques would have made this one pop more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless, I was pretty proud of it!

            and error, but I was able to replicate the look in Shapr3D! It felt really good to figure it out, using an angled
            body that is mirror about the z-axis and rotated / cloned.">
