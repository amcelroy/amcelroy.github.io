        Howdy. My name is Austin and I live in Austin. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a B.S. in Electrical Engineer (2004) from the University of Texas, Austin, and a M.S.E.E. from UT
        Austin (2021). I've had a pretty awesome career working with a lot of great people and getting to learn
        about a lot of different topics: optics, high speed computing, analog circuit design, controls, machine learning,
        and since finishing my M.S.E.E., I've been working on embedded systems, firmare, Rust, large language models, 
        mesh nebulizer drive circuits, digital PCB design, including my first PCBs with MCUs and BLE.
    </p>

    <p>
        Programming has become a passion, hobby, and career, doing projects in: C, Labview, C++, CUDA, OpenCL, Python, Typescript,
        and Rust. Mostly in that order. Most of my work now is Rust, Typescript, and Python. All of my firmware in the 
        last few years is exclusively in Rust, including hobby projects like the picture frame and supporting libraries
        to run the <code>dotstar</code> LEDs.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Pictorus working on bringing Rust to model based design system for embedded systems. My current task is trying
        to absorb as much of the software base as I can, implement new hardware protocols, PCB design, and helping re-write an open source implementation of 
        the Rust project. It has been an amazing learning experience for CI/CD, Rust, generated code, and more. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Most of my previous work has been in biomedical R and D, working on a variety of projects from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
        imaging systems, speckle flood flow imaging, pace maker detectors, multi-mesh nebulizers, cardiac admittance volume
        measurement systems, 3D printer laser sintering control systems and high speed imaging, and more. My new job is definitely a change of pace, 
        but I am enjoying the new challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hobbies: mountain biking (south Austin has a LOT of trails), roller blading, any biking with my son, date night with my wife, visiting with family,
        3D printing, PCB design, firmware, any facet of electrical engineering, learning, trying to be a good human.

        This website is a work in progress. It is a SvelteKit SSR project compiled as a static site and hosted 
        on Github Pages. It is a place to showcase my work and hobbies and keep some engineering tools handy. Check out 
        my resume, publications, patents, StackOverflow profile, Github profile, and projects; shoot me an email if you 
        have any questions.

        I wrote this website using SvelteKit using the <a href="https://www.skeleton.dev/" style="color: lightgreen;">Skeleton UI library</a>. They
        kindly provided a nice starter project that uses Vite. I used <a href="https://github.com/vinibiavatti1/TuiCss" style="color: lightgreen;">TUI CSS</a> for the RaptorOS look and feel, I wanted to incorporate something...different, 
        and the retro DOS feel seemed perfect. Thanks to all the folks at Skeleton UI and TuiCss and all the other dependencies I used.
