        This website is a work in progress. This is a SvelteKit SSR project compiled as a static site and hosted 
        on Github Pages. It is a place to showcase my work and hobbies and keep some engineering tools handy. Check out 
        my resume, publications, patents, StackOverflow profile, Github profile, and projects; shoot me an email if you 
        have any questions.

        I have a B.S. in Electrical Engineer from the University of Texas, Austin, and finished up a M.S.E.E at UT during
        the COVID pandemic. My masters thesis was part of a team; I designed the circuit board and firmware for a low-cost bridge 
        ventilator unit. The team was lead by Dr. Thomas Milner, Dr. Johnathan Valvano, Dr. Van Trusket, and many, many others. 
        Thought we moved fast, the vaccine came out as we were submitting the device to the FDA under the emergancy authorization
        act and it was deemed not needed. Regardless, it was an amazing experience that made us feel empowered during a time of a 
        lot of uncertainty.

        I'm a Staff Scientist for a company called BridgeSource medical. We write NIH grants and do the research
        and engineering work, so there are always a lot of diverse projects going on. I primarily write firmware for 
        microcontrollers and GUI visualization software for desktops using Rust, but also work regularly in C, C++, Svelte,
        Flutter, and Python.

        I wrote this website using SvelteKit using the <a href="https://www.skeleton.dev/" style="color: lightgreen;">Skeleton UI library</a>. They
        kindly provided a nice starter project that uses Vite. I used <a href="https://github.com/vinibiavatti1/TuiCss" style="color: lightgreen;">TUI CSS</a> for the RaptorOS look and feel, I wanted to incorporate something...different, 
        and the retro DOS feel seemed perfect. Thanks to all the folks at Skeleton UI and TuiCss and all the other dependencies I used.
